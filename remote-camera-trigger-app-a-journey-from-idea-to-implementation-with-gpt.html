In this post, I’ll walk you through how I developed this website in less than 10 hours with a little help from GPT - hopefully shedding light on how developers use Large Language Models</p><h2 id="what--why">What &amp; Why</h2><p>The “Photo Trigger App” was born out of a need for convenience and a desire to test the end-to-end development capabilities of GPT. The goal was simple:  </p><p><strong>What</strong>:</p><ul><li>Create an app that uses the play/pause button of Bluetooth headphones to trigger the camera</li><li>Use Chat GPT with the WebDev plugin (<a href="https://converter.app/webdev-chatgpt-plugin/">WebDev</a>)</li></ul><p><strong>Why</strong>:</p><ul><li>To capture group photos without the need to fumble with the phone’s timer <a href="https://conradbez.com/camera-trigger/">conradbez.com/camera-trigger</a></li><li>Test and demonstrate how modern developers can work with GPT</li></ul><h2 id="development-with-gpt">Development with GPT</h2><p>It’s always advisable to address technical uncertainties at the outset. With the Photo Trigger App, two primary concerns emerged: potential restrictions by Apple on browser camera access and the challenge of intercepting the play/pause button press on AirPods. Addressing these concerns was crucial for the MVP.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of my development process with GPT:</p><ol><li><strong>Develop in GPT</strong>: Requested a basic prototype of the video component.</li><li><strong>Test in GPT</strong>: Previewed the prototype on an iPhone.</li><li><strong>Iterate in GPT</strong>: Identified issues and sought corrections.</li><li><strong>Test in GPT</strong>: Validated the video functionality.</li><li><strong>Develop in GPT</strong>: Requested audio playback functionality.</li><li><strong>Iterate in GPT</strong>: Enhanced audio playback to trigger events.</li><li><strong>Develop in GPT</strong>: Integrated audio and video components.</li><li><strong>Iterate outside GPT</strong>: Made further refinements.</li><li><strong>Productionise outside GPT</strong>: Deployed the MVP.</li><li><strong>Iterate outside GPT</strong>: Addressed complexities beyond GPT’s capabilities.</li></ol><p>GPT proved invaluable during the rapid prototyping stage, especially when navigating unfamiliar browser APIs. The entire process, from ideation to a working prototype, took a mere two hours with GPT, as opposed to the 10-12 hours it might have taken traditionally.</p><h2 id="strengths--limitations-of-gpt">Strengths &amp; Limitations of GPT</h2><p><strong>Strengths</strong>:  </p><ul><li>Ideal for mobile development on-the-go.</li><li>Enables non-technical individuals to create rough prototypes swiftly.</li></ul><p>   <strong>Limitations</strong>:  </p><ul><li>Struggles with integration issues and hands-on debugging.</li><li>Challenges arise when multiple systems interact or when broader architecting is required.</li></ul><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>GPT is a game-changer for prototyping, offering a tailored solution that often surpasses traditional templates. However, it has its limitations, especially with complex debugging tasks or broader system engineering. My journey with the “Photo Trigger App” was enlightening, and as I wrap up, I’d like to share a note from GPT on it’s thoughts of our brief yet productive collaboration:</p><p><strong>Capturing Moments with a Beat: Integrating Camera with Bluetooth Headphones</strong></p><p>In today’s digital age, the fusion of technology often leads to innovative solutions that simplify our lives or add a touch of magic to our daily routines. One such intriguing blend is the integration of camera functionality with Bluetooth headphones. Imagine pausing your favorite track and instantly capturing a moment, all without touching your phone. Sounds futuristic, right? But it’s a reality we’ve brought to life in our latest project. This endeavor was inspired by the seamless experience of AirPods and other Bluetooth headphones. Users frequently interact with their devices using play/pause buttons on their headphones, so why not leverage this interaction for more than just audio control? With this thought, we embarked on a journey to create a web-based application that captures a photo every time you play or pause your music. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the intricacies of this project, exploring the challenges faced, the technologies used, and the potential applications of such an integration. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast, a developer, or someone who loves innovative solutions, this read promises to offer a fresh perspective on the possibilities that lie at the intersection of audio and visual tech. Join us as we unravel the magic behind “Photo with Bluetooth Headphones.”</p><p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/1c7ecdf6-4d08-4168-a180-862845b6e46e">Link</a> to the GPT chat session used (be warned it’s messy!)</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://conradbezuidenhout.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
